# HEAT_GUN
After assembling two very similar and very different soldering iron, I decided to collect HEAT GUN, I am quite rarely using a cheap Chinese Heat Gun directly for mounting or dismantling the components, but I use heat-shrink insulation. 
What I got to watch the video. 
And of course materials on this site.
You can look at the video.
